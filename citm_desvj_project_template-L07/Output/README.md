# The Toy Box - FUN MAKERS STUDIOS

## Description

The Toy Box is a role playing game in which a group of friends go into a gigantic toy store that has recently settled in town at the request of the main character’s little sister, when the group goes in they find themselves surrounded by shelves filled with toys and games for all ages and some incredible displays but there is no one inside; the group goes to explore the store separately.

In Toy Box, players will travel through the four zones of the world, each of these zones will have a different theme.
